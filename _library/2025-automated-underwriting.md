summary: Presents a multi-modal deep learning architecture for processing medical records and financial documents in automated underwriting.
---

We introduce a transformer-based architecture that jointly processes structured and unstructured inputs for insurance underwriting decisions. The model ingests medical records, lab results, and financial statements to produce risk classifications.

**Approach:** Multi-modal transformer with document understanding pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning.

**Results:** 23% reduction in manual review requirements while maintaining underwriting quality standards across three validation cohorts.

**Evidence:** Production deployment since Q3 2024; external validation by model risk management.
