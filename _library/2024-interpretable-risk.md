summary: Develops inherently interpretable models for life insurance risk scoring with regulatory compliance.
---

This work addresses the challenge of building accurate yet interpretable risk models for life insurance underwriting. We propose a neural additive model variant that maintains interpretability while achieving competitive accuracy.

**Problem:** Regulatory requirements demand explainable decisions in life insurance, limiting adoption of black-box models.

**Approach:** Generalized additive models with neural network shape functions, providing per-feature risk contributions.

**Results:** Within 2% AUC of ensemble methods while maintaining complete feature-level transparency.
