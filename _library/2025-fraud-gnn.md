summary: Novel graph neural network approach for detecting organized fraud rings in insurance claims.
---

We present a heterogeneous graph neural network architecture for detecting fraud patterns in insurance claims. The model identifies both individual fraudulent claims and organized fraud rings through relational reasoning.

**Problem:** Traditional rule-based systems miss sophisticated fraud patterns involving multiple coordinated actors.

**Approach:** Heterogeneous GNN operating over claim-claimant-provider graphs with temporal attention mechanisms.

**Results:** 34% improvement in fraud detection rate at fixed false positive rate compared to production baseline.

**Deployment:** Pilot deployment in Q1 2025; full production rollout planned for Q3 2025.
