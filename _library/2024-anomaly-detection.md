summary: Unsupervised anomaly detection methods for identifying unusual claim patterns without labeled fraud data.
---

We develop unsupervised methods for flagging anomalous health insurance claims. The approach is particularly valuable in domains where labeled fraud examples are scarce or biased toward known fraud types.

**Problem:** Supervised fraud detection is limited by the availability and quality of historical fraud labels.

**Approach:** Variational autoencoder with claims-specific reconstruction objectives and uncertainty quantification.

**Results:** Identified 12% additional fraudulent claims missed by supervised baselines in retrospective analysis.
